We have made extensions actually installable, which means each extension gets its own repo, either in the lnbits org, or somewhere else, whichever is preferred. The process does remove the commit history, so its better if the extension author copies into the repo. If the author wants to use this repo all they need do is copy https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits/tree/main/lnbits/extensions/market into it. Thanks!
